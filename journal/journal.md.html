2025-10-15: New Journal Entry
=============================================================

1 hr 7 min

Hoping to finish the staircase part today
Ok so after an unecessary long itme, I realized to do texture mapping you need to put your own textures
into the data files folder, i.e wood.png

MY LORD I DO NOT EANT TO MANUALLY MAKE THESE SCENE FILES USING PRINT F ANYMORE
took like 10 mins to find a typo
Now I just need to set up the staircase properly lol

I found some good example of how to use the area light here: C:\Users\Vladimir\Downloads\GraphicsCodex\data10\common\scene
ok I spent most of the time today understanding how to create a scene file using textOutput
Remember to always call .commit() at the end after creating the file


2025-10-12: New Journal Entry
=============================================================

![](2025-10-12__000.jpg)

I just needed to quickly make a new entry

started: 8:48 pm
ended: 9:45 pm
(1 hour)

I guess today I want to finish up working on task 2, so the cornell box I jsut moved the walls as needed in the editor

Ok I spent wayyyy too long trying to get the lighting fixed and I didn't even get it, like the "OMNI" light just doesnt work
and IDK how to make the skybox less bright, NEXT WORK ON PART 3


2025-10-07: New Section
=============================================================

![Testing ss feature](2025-10-07__000_Testing_ss_feature.jpg)

F4 while in program to take SS and add caption and desc

Ok so for project One I am starting now,
first I want to find where all these things are located:
models/crate/*, cubemap/whiteroom/whiteroom-*.png, and texture maps (images):

the last two I found at: https://casual-effects.com/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/dataindex.html#Images

but I cant find the path for models/

nvm I just crashed the program and it showed me its at this path: C:\Users\Vladimir\Downloads\GraphicsCodex\data10\game\model 

Ok I actually started the program at 9:06 pm today (was reading through report and othersection about the project first)

finished today at 9:37 pm , almost done 2nd task (30 mins)

Ok now lets talk about each scene:

1. should be simple, will edit the whitecube scene file, slightly done already in the warmup guide
    - it looks like coordinate axis is as follows Y/yaw(vertical), X/pitch(horizontal), Z/roll(towards starting camera pos)
    - done
2. ok so it seems that I need to create multiple instances of the cubes, I wonder if I can edit them directly in the editor
    - ok gotcha, so basically we can work both in the editor and the scene files,
    - to edit in the editor we need to disable the lock, then change the object and you want and then make sure to click the save button and it will edit the Scene file
